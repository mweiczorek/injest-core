# Injest Core

This is a privately-used REST framework. No documentation is available.
This is only a public repo because I'm too cheap to purchase a JitPack subscription.

There are likely to be breaking changes between patches and minor versions, and without 
deprecation warnings. Consider yourself warned!

Perhaps someday I'll add docs for the public to use and consume, but for now, 
if you use this library, you're on your own.
